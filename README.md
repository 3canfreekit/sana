## üí° Introduction
We introduce Sana, a text-to-image framework that can efficiently generate images up to 4096 √ó 4096 resolution. 
Sana can synthesize high-resolution, high-quality images with strong text-image alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on laptop GPU. 
Core designs include:

(1) [DC-AE](https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/dc-ae): unlike traditional AEs, which compress images only 8√ó, we trained an AE that can compress images 32√ó, effectively reducing the number of latent tokens. \
(2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in DiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without sacrificing quality. \
(3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern decoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human instruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment. \
(4) Efficient training and sampling: we propose **Flow-DPM-Solver** to reduce sampling steps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence.

As a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model (e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured throughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking less than 1 second to generate a 1024 √ó 1024 resolution image. Sana enables content creation at low cost.
